One of the key objects represented in the "**Library**" space is **Folder**. It is an entity similar to the directories in the file system. Folders are used to structure other CP objects. Folders can be arranged into a tree like a file system, which helps to store information divided by departments, users, programs or other logical groups.  
**_Note_**: there is a special type of Folder - a **Project**. For details see [here](../Appendix_B/Appendix_B._Working_with_a_Project.md).

## "Details" view

"**Details**" panel shows contents of the selected folder: subfolders, files, pipelines etc.

## Controls

The following buttons are available at the top of the "**Details**" view of the folder:

### Upload metadata

"**Upload metadata**" (**1**) control allows a user to upload new metadata entities (e.g. Samples, Participants) from the .csv/.tsv/.tdf files in a project or another folder selected by a user. It helps to organize and manage metadata in a user's workspace (project or some sandbox folder for collecting metadata). Learn more [5.2. Upload metadata](../05_Manage_Metadata/5.2._Upload_metadata.md).

### + Create

A user can add:

- a CP objects to the selected folder with the **Create** button (**2**). See [4.1. Create an object in Folder](4.1._Create_an_object_in_Folder.md);
- create a CP object from a template. See [Appendix B. Working with a Project](../Appendix_B/Appendix_B._Working_with_a_Project.md).  
    **_Note_**: The list of templates could be extended.
