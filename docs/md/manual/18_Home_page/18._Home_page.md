### Active runs

List of the jobs/tools that are currently in **RUNNING** or **PAUSED** state with some information about instance, elapsed time and estimated price, that is calculated based on the run duration and instance type. If this list is empty - start a new run from the **Tools** or **Pipelines** widgets. Hover a run item to view a list of available action.  
Use **STOP**/**PAUSE**/**RESUME** actions to change the state of the run or use OPEN to navigate to the GUI of the interactive job. Select the **LINKS** button to view/navigate the run input/output parameters. Click a run item to navigate to the details and logs page. **_Note_**: only top 50 active runs will be shown, if more than 50 jobs/tools are running - use **Explore all active runs** link.

Compared to the **ACTIVE RUNS** widget - this one does NOT show all the active jobs/tools, only links to the web/desktop GUI. If this list is empty - start a new run of an interactive compute stack from the **Tools** widget. Click an item within this widget to navigate to the corresponding service.

1. Navigate to the **Home** tab.
2. Select a Tool in the **Tools** widget.
3. Click **Run**.
